        <h3>Get Ready for Flavortown Baby!</h3>
        <p>Today we are going to make the meanest lasagna that will have your neighbors breaking into your house just to get a taste of that wonderful smell. No more getting harrassed on the block for serving up pig slop at every potluck, no this time you are going to show them, you're going to show all of them. Even that smug prick Chad with his own homemade rib rub the whole town can't stop mentioning any time the subject of ribs is even brought up will be left sleepless, wondering how in the hell you managed to cook such a dish with the power to induce flavor enlightenment upon all those lucky enough to have a bite.</p>
        <p>As with every recipe on this website, we require all those who are foolish enough to try to imitate my food to start off with <strong>HOMEGROWN FRESH NATURAL INGREDIENTS</strong>. If you are unable to grow the food yourself or raise the livestock yourself then forget even trying to replicate this recipe, because your dish will be woefully disappointing.</p>
        <ul><h3>What You Will Need</h3>
            <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1-1/4 pounds bulk Italian sausage</li>
